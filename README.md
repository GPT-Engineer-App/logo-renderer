# logo-renderer

I want you to build a website using React and Chakra UI on the frontend, Express.js and FFmpeg on the backend.

The user will select the video they want from their computer through this website and the video they have selected will appear as a preview on the site. Then he will be able to select and add a logo anywhere in this video from his computer. There will be a button called "Render" under the preview section. When the user clicks this button, the video to which the user has added the logo will be downloaded in 1:1 720p format.
